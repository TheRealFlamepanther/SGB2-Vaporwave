# Super Game Boy 2: Vaporwave Edition

These source files can be used to build a custom vaporwave version of the Super Game Boy 2 system ROM. The official build is available as a readymade IPS patch here:

More information about the project is available at the above link as well.

## IPS

These patches implement the changes that had to be hacked into the ROM manually. They are meant to be stacked, and can be applied with any decent IPS patching tool.

The patch to implement the Arizona Boy border WILL NOT WORK on a ROM that has not had at least one border added via the SGB2 Border Injector (see below)

## PNG

These images can be injected into the ROM using the SGB2 Border Injector by Blizz:

The 45-color images are already color-reduced and ready for injection. The full-color images will suffer severe quality loss if injected as they are. These are included for remixing, and for potential uses with fewer/different color restrictions such as bezels for emulators or the MiSTer FPGA project.
